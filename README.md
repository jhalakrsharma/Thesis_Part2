# Thesis_Part2
This project discuss about the characterization and propagation of the fault on a RISC-V Processor (PicoRV32).
There are two steps (1) Simulation flow and (2) FPGA Implementation flow
Each folder consistis of following:
  1. Golden source code
  2. Faulty source code
  3. Faulty output file (for reference)
  4. Python script for automation (for reference)
  5. In FPGA flow, TCL script for self-triggering ILA (for reference)
